Linux File Structure:
      /  = root directory (Folder)

home  = users created in Linux
------------------------------
lanmark 
simon 
femi 
dominion 
   ls --list files and directories 
   ls /home 

bin -- contains binary files (commands)
=====================================
 ls 
 touch = create a file
 cd 
 pwd 
 cat = display the content of a file 
 whoami 
   ls /bin 

sbin = system binary files
--------------------------
- adduser simon
- useradd landmark
- passwd simon
- init 0 or shutdown
- yum = install, upgrade and updates packages 

  NIS --> 

users with elevated priviledges
 Files that can be executed by admin users ONLY 

What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux? 
 sbin are binary files only executable by users 
   with root, admin or users with elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 

classes users:
    Normal users: 
       landmark
       eric 
       femi
     adduser eric 

    Root / superuser / admin: = 
       root
     root user is created while installing a Linux server
       Launch an EC2 Instance
    system users: 
       users created while installing softwares
       httpd 
       jenkins 
 
===============================

  touch test.txt 

/opt = downloading and installation of softwares 
-------------------------------------
 nexus
 sonarqube
 tomcat 

/lib
---

/etc = configuration files
==========================
- /etc/passwd  = info about all users 
- /etc/shadow  = info about all users  password 
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

 cat = display the content of a file

cat /etc/shadow
cat: /etc/shadow: Permission denied

 sudo cat /etc/shadow

 We grant sudo  access to users which we want to
   elevate their priviledges

 ec2-user has sudo priviledges 
 NB: Only users with elevated priviledges can add 
          "sudo" before a command

tmp - temporal file holder 
=========================
