 Automating IT processes
===========================

  Computer:
    Bare Metal or Hard Ware 
      RAM - Memory
      Cpu -
      ROM 
      MOUSE
      KEYBOARD
    Software component 
      operating system = OS = 
         Windows 
         Solaris 
         MacOS 
         Linux:

      other softwares :
         shell 
         Sublime 
         Microsoft word/Excell  

  IT/Computer usage / management :
    GUI = Graphical user interface 
        pro:  simple and easy to understand 
        cons: security lapses 
              Time consuming 

    CLI = command line interface
      CONS: Complex
      pros: automation 
            security
            fast and serves time () 

  Windows OS (operating system)
     Windows 10 Home / Professional 
     Windows servers = 2012 / 2016 / 2019 
  Powershell 
  MX-DOS commands 

  MacOS 
  Linux  OS   :
    touch
    ls  
  shell   :

boa / rbc /payPal / aa / NIS / 

How to run multiple commands in Linux:
  script 
  seperator &&
    whoami && pwd && ls 
    whoami;  pwd;  ls
  
  pipe is use when the output of a command
   is the input of another command 
     cat logs | grep errors 

A script is a collection of commands in a file
  hello 

what is a shell:
 is a program that interpretes commands to the OS

 ls --> list the content of a directory

Types of shells in Linus:
  sh 
  bash 
  csh 
  ksh 
  tsh 
What is the default shell:
  bash -- Bourne again shell 
  sh   -- Bourne shell

  echo $SHELL

  cat /etc/shells 

  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Hello"
  whoami
  echo  "Good morning"
  echo "Today's date is"
  date 

Naming convention :
  shell-script = .sh or .sc
    hello.sh / 
    hello.sc 
    hello 
  java-code = .java
    hello.java 
  python 
    hello.py 
  text file 
    hello.txt 
  html web page = .html

  cat /etc/shells
  echo $SHELL 

 Naming convention :
   .sh or .sc = for shell script 

   deploy.sh
   uploadSSHkeys.sh
   monitor.sc     

 =#!/bin/sh 


hello.sh 
./hello.sh

A script should have executable permissions to run

chmod +x hello.sh

 cd 

sc/hello.sh 



A shell is an interpreter 
  ls is interpreted to the computer by a shell 

#!/bin/bash
echo "DevOps is great"
echo "study devops now with your family"
whoami
pwd
echo "today's date is `date`"

  sh hello2 
  bash hello2 
  csh hello2 


 /bin/bash  /bin/sh
=#!/bin/bash   : 
echo "Hello Guys"
echo "Welcome to ShellScript"
echo "This is the first shell script example !!"
echo "Today date is" `date`
echo "Shellscript is very easy" 

How to run a script :
    ./scriptName  
     ./hello.sh  
-bash: ./firstScript.sh: Permission denied
 -rw-rw-r--
  o   g  o
  6   6  4 = 664
 chmod  +x fileName 
 chmod +x firstScript.sh
  -rwx rwx r-x
 # 
 chmod +x script-file-name #

 chmod 755 script file name

yum install csh 


  hello2.sh    :
  date 
  ls 
  pwd 
  whoami
  echo "Thanks" 

  sh hello2.sh

  bash hello2.sh

Linux is case sensitive 
 commands are in lower cases 

Resolving issues from a script?
 1. Run the script in debugging mode
   sh -x  debug.sh 

debug.sh 
date
set -x
Echo "Devops is good"
ls
set +x
  pwd
  whoami
  echo "Thanks"

2. vi and correct the script


  csh 

  ksh 
  =#kc-shell.sh 
  use scripting to manage packages in Linux

IQ: Explain your scripting experience?

1. Package management:
#!/bin/sh
echo 'start installing packages'
sudo yum install ksh csh tsh git -y
echo "Installations successful. Bye"

 cat /etc/shells

  Use to eplain the script file

 #!/bin/sh
comment: = explains the code for better usability 
This is a shell script that runs in Linux OS ONLY  
This script is use for managing packages

 Scripting or automation langauges :
  1. Bash Shell Scripting
  2. Python 
  3. Groovy  (Jenkins)
  4. Yaml (k8s, Ansible, CloudFormation)
  5. JSon 
  6. HCL = terraform  
  7. XML 
  8. html
  9. Go & Golang    
       

cat /etc/shells

pwd
date
whoami
hostname -i
ls
echo "DevOps is good"

secondscript.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "DevOps need patients"
echo "Also be consistent"
date

1)	bash hello.sh
2)	sh hello.sh
3)	./hello.sh
4)	. hello.sh
    . /home/simon/sc/mlc.sh

Scripting automate tasks on a localhost(1server) 
Ansible automate tasks on multi-hosts (1000)
 1. user management 
    file management 
    packages management 
    export ssh-keys 
    monitor_server 
    deploy.sh 

 2. 

# 
comment  = metadata  :
    data about adata
     Use to explain the script file
  
vi comment  :
  press "i" to enter insert mode
  press esc key to enter command mode
  press ":wq" to save and quit
